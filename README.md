# Text to Image Encryption and Decryption

This Python script has a method for encrypting text into an image and decrypting the text back from the image using different algorithms.

## Features

- **Encrypt Text to Image**: Convert plain text into an encrypted image using a chosen algorithm.
- **Decrypt Image to Text**: Retrieve the original text from the encrypted image.
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**: Choose from different algorithms for encryption and decryption.

## Algorithms

1. **Bit Shifting**: Shifts bits to the left by one position.
2. **Bit Reversal**: Reverses the order of bits.
3. **XOR with Key**: Uses XOR operation with a given key.
4. **Addition to Red Channel**: Adds a key value to the red color channel.
5. **Substitution Cipher**: Applies a simple substitution cipher.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pillow (PIL)

You can install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
